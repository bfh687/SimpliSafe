## SimpliSafe Security System Clone

This is a project where our group was tasked with mimicking all hardware/software features found in the [SimpliSafe security system](https://simplisafe.com/build-my-system). All hardware is represented via GUIs which control the security system, and the rest of our code represents the security system itself (MVC Model). The system consists of a "base station," which communicates with all the subsystems. The system has all functionality of a normal security system, including arming/disarming, panic buttons, and security sensors/cameras.

## Hardware Support (GUI)
* Base Station
* Keypads
* Alarms
* Security Sensors
  * CO/Smoke/Temperature/Flood Sensors
  * Entry/Glass-Break/Motion Sensors
* Panic Buttons
* Security Cameras

## UML
For this project we used UML to plan our system before implementation. This allowed us to cover all use cases and resolve potential issues beforehand. In addition, we were able to assign roles and tasks to members so that each member had their own responsibilites. Below are a couple notable diagrams that helped greatly with implementation.
